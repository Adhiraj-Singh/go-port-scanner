# ðŸ”Ž Concurrent Port Scanner in Go

A super simple and fast **port scanner** written in Go using **concurrency**. This project scans a range of TCP ports on a given host and reports which ports are open â€” all done in parallel using Goâ€™s lightweight goroutines!

## ðŸ“Œ What is a Port Scanner?

A **port scanner** is a tool used to detect open ports on a target machine. Each port represents a specific service (like HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443), and open ports can indicate which services are running and potentially accessible.

This project demonstrates:
- Basic network communication with `net.Dial`
- Parallel execution using **goroutines**
- Communication using **channels**

## ðŸš€ Features

- Scans any host over TCP (default: `localhost`)
- Scans ports from 1 to 1024
- Uses concurrency to scan **all ports in parallel**
- Easy to extend and customize
